CHR sometimes gets called "lingua franca of computer science" ([Frühwirth; 2009](#ref-fruhwirth2009talk)), due to its unification of several rule-based approaches. Currently the prevalence of CHR is still too small to claim this title. By embedding CHR into JavaScript - the dominating programming language of the web that recently got adopted for server-side frameworks too -, we open this declararative approach to a broad range of developers and new use cases.

In this project report we present a first prototype implementation of a CHR-to-JavaScript transpiler called *CHR.js*. Out contributions are:

- [CHR.js](https://github.com/fnogatz/CHR.js): the first integration of CHR with JavaScript,
- [CHR.js-website](https://github.com/fnogatz/CHR.js-website): a web application that allows the compilation and execution of CHR in JavaScript, available at [chrjs.net](http://chrjs.net/).
